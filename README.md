# MPI-Codes
These are some examples of how to write make your code run in parallel using MPI library in C.                                                                                                                                     
To compile a code type "mpicc <file-name>.c -o <output-file-name>".                                                                                                                                                                  
To run the code type "mpirun -np <num-of-processors> ./<output-file-name>".
